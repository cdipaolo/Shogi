#Shogi King
This is an iOS 8 version of an extremely popular Japanese 'variant' (it was created around the same time) of western chess. I have commented a lot of code so anybody looking to do a similar project can *hopefully* get what I am doing.

#Reasons for Making Source Open
- For people who want to learn to do board game representation, this will be a resource.
- People who want to learn to implement Minimax w/ α-β pruning can use it as a resource
- People wanting to learn how to create static evaluation functions can use this as a resource.
- People wanting to create their own shogi game can use the board and pieces I created for their own game.

#Plan
- ~~Get two player working~~
- Create static evaluation function (probably will need to create neural net)
- Implement minimax with alpha-beta pruning

##Goals for after app is working and on App Store
- Possibly change to more efficient bitboard representation of board, which is harder to implement on the Shogi 9x9 board but still should be better
- Multiplayer over internet?
- Improve static eval function. Neural net with genetic algorithm for computer to self-play?
